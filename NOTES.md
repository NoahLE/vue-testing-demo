# Random Notes

- Be sure to check the documentation. Some examples here are using calls which will be depreciated in the future.

- You should always write a failing test first to make sure it's working correctly. Then make sure it passes.
- Difference between `mount` and `shallowMount` is stubs (fake objects) are used for inserted Vue components.
- You generally want to use `mount` because it is closer to how the application actually behaves.
